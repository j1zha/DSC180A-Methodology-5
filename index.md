## Assignment Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
- I feel like is the CB-LLM model. The CB-LLM allows us to understand how LLMs make decisions by attributing their outputs to a set of interpretable concepts.
What fascinates me most is its potential to combine interpretability with high-performing models without compromising accuracy.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
- I would like to investigate how the CB-LLM model could be applied to more dynamic datasets. Specifically, I am curious about its application in Time-series data: Can CB-LLM concepts provide meaningful explanations for predictions in domains like financial forecasting, healthcare trends, or environmental data?

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
- I would use Figma more. Instead of relying solely on code-based visualizations, incorporating Figma could help design clear and interactive concept explanations for end-users.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
- Try to learn how to build a web app. Developing a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the model outputs. For example, they could explore how different input concepts influence predictions, improving transparency and usability.
